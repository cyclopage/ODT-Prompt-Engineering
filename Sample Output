### SECTION 1 — ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS DECOMPOSITION

*Atmospheric:*
- 100% Helium atmosphere, no oxygen or breathable gases.
- High helium pressure (1 bar) requires immediate decompression to avoid inert gas narcosis and oxygen
deprivation.
- Presence of reactive hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) in trace amounts (0.1%) which is toxic.

*Gravitational:*
- Gravity at 0.9g, slightly reduced from Earth standard, but sufficient for normal bipedal locomotion. No direct
modification required.

*Thermal:*
- High average temperature (40°C) with solar flares and time-loops causing unpredictable thermal spikes. Requires
rapid thermoregulation.

*Chemical:*
- Toxic buildup from H₂S and other volatile compounds. Low pressure environment requires efficient gas exchange.

*Radiation / Exotic:*
- Solar flares and temporal anomalies causing radiation exposure and time-disruption effects. Requires shielding
and temporal stability.
